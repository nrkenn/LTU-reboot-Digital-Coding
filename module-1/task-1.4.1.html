<h1>1.4 - 15/10/20</h1>

<p>In this session we did some basic HTML coding and learnt about branches. It was really interesting to learn about plugin numbers and that the numbers used correspond to different types of changes and fixes. I'd always seen these in programs I use, but didn't realise exactly what this referred to.</p>
<p>It's become clear about the importance of Git in tracking change management and monitoring changes. I'm also clear now on there being multiple versions of an app or website and the benefits of working in branches (espcially for multiple devs working on tasks similtainously) before merging into the master. I also now understand how to switch branches on GitHub now.</p>
<p>I understand the necessity of the use of commit and its 'save game' function to trace back in my code when needed if something goes wrong. It was good to start using and understanding specific HTML tags and I'm looking forward in due course to being able to visualise Git.</p>
