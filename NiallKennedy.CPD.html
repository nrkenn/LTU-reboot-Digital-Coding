<h2>HTML</h2>

<p>I have learnt numerous new skills in HTML since beginning the course.
    At its most basic HTML can be described as elements within containers and it dictates the structure of a document that's being put together and what data is important on the site.
    We have been learning HTML5 and we started by learning about the use of paragrpah and header tags. We learnt about the historical background of HTML and it's creation through mark up languages used in scientific papers that referenced others. The W3 consortium are now in charge of the standardising of HTML.
    Elements are individual components of HTML (for example, paragraphs, headings, lists, links, etc) and tags mark the beginning and end of a specific element in the code.
    I now understand the difference between inline and block elements and their appearence either within a line or starting on a new line.
    I've learnt the anatomy of an HTML element and the difference between container elements and standalone elements. I know that additional information about the HTML element is added through attributes.
    Doctypes tell the browser which version of the markup language the page is using.
    I've understood the benefits of using Lorem Ispum when creating HTML documents in order to flesh it out with body text.
    Heading numbers indicate hierarchy, not size. Ordering in header elements is important with h3s, following h2s and so on.
