<h2>HTML</h2>

<p>I have learnt numerous new skills in HTML since beginning the course.
    At its most basic HTML can be described as elements within containers and it dictates the structure of a document that's being put together and what data is important on the site.
    <p>We have been learning HTML5 and we started by learning about the use of paragraph and header tags.</p> 
    <p>We learnt about the historical background of HTML and its creation through mark up languages used in scientific papers that referenced others. The W3 consortium are now in charge of the standardising of HTML.</p>
    <p>Elements are individual components of HTML (for example, paragraphs, headings, lists, links, etc) and tags mark the beginning and end of a specific element in the code.</p>
    <p>I now understand the difference between inline and block elements and their appearence either within a line or starting on a new line.</p>
    <p>I've learnt the anatomy of an HTML element and the difference between container elements and standalone elements. I know that additional information about the HTML element is added through attributes.</p>
    <p>I've understood the benefits of using Lorem Ispum when creating HTML documents in order to flesh it out with body text. Heading numbers indicate hierarchy, not size. Ordering in header elements is important with h3s, following h2s and so on.</p>
    <p>We have also covered other specific elements of HTML coding including nesting within tags, the correctly using images in HTML, inserting links using tagging, including the additional elements in tags to enable these to open in new tabs.</p>
    <p>I'm now clear on the best pratice for coding ordered and unordered lists and the importance of correctly creating tables with balanced elements so they look right.</p>
    <p>I'm now clear on the best practice for coding ordered and unordered lists and the importance of correctly creating tables with balanced elements.</p>
    <p>It was really useful to get a practical explanation of the benefits of using comments when working on a project as a team too.</p>
    <p>I took the HTML quiz on w3schools and got 30 out of 40.</p>

    <p>In today's lesson we covered alot of ground on CSS and its further links and interplay with HTML code.</p>
    <p>We examined property values, including font families and sizing, and the hierarchical nature of these.</p>
    <p>We also looked at selector positions and IDs, as well as cascading priorities. And we looked at divs and further inline elements like span tags.</p>
    <p>I personally found this lesson really interesting and understanding the linkages between coding in HTML for content and the correlation between this in design terms through the CSS elements we were inputting was fascinating.</p>
    <p>While I feel I had a good grasp of the concepts discussed and understood how the respective elements led on from one and other, I did struggle to keep up with coding between HTML and CSS different windows, but I'm going to go back over the elements of task 2.2.5 I missed and I'm confident that I'll speed up as I code more.</p>

    <h4>29/10/20</h4>
    <p>Learning about the Box Model in this lesson was really helpful in visualising webpage layout and it was good to see the boxed shapes I was creating appearing and being able to manipulate this. I now understand about positioning of padding, border and margin, and the coding for these, as well as the interplay between the HTML and CSS on this. I struggled with getting task 2.3.4 to work correctly so will revisit this.</p>
